E-Commerce Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project

üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing E-Commerce transaction data to gain insights into customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and business strategies using Machine Learning. It covers customer segmentation, churn prediction, market basket analysis, revenue prediction, and customer lifetime value calculations.

üìÇ Dataset Information

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data

Number of Records: 522,698

Number of Features: 9

Key Features: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country, TotalPrice

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values (Description, CustomerID imputed appropriately)

Excluded irrelevant transactions (e.g., bank charges, postage)

Created new feature: TotalPrice = Quantity √ó UnitPrice

Outlier handling using IQR-Based Capping, Winsorization, and Percentile-Based Capping

üîç Problem Statements & Methodologies

1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Churn Prediction

Goal: Identify customers who are likely to stop purchasing.

Methods:

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM

Feature Engineering: Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM), purchase patterns

Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

Best Model: XGBoost (AUC-ROC: 0.91)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

Goal: Categorize customers into meaningful groups.

Methods:

K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering

Features used: RFM metrics, purchasing frequency, basket size

Evaluated using Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index

Best Model: K-Means (Optimal K = 4, Silhouette Score = 0.73)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Predicting Customer Purchase Probability

Goal: Estimate the likelihood of a customer making a future purchase.

Methods:

Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

Feature Engineering: Customer tenure, purchase patterns, seasonality trends

Evaluated using Log-Loss, ROC-AUC Score

Best Model: Decision Tree (ROC-AUC = 0.89)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Market Basket Analysis & Recommendation System

Goal: Identify frequently bought product combinations & suggest recommendations.

Methods:

Apriori Algorithm, FP-Growth for association rules

Created Recommendation System based on frequent itemsets

Results: Identified Top 10 frequently bought product pairs, optimized for cross-selling.

5Ô∏è‚É£ High-Value Customer Analysis

Goal: Identify top-spending customers and analyze their behavior.

Methods:

RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value)

Pareto Principle (80/20 rule for revenue distribution)

Results: Top 20% of customers contribute 75% of revenue.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

Goal: Estimate future revenue from customers.

Methods:

Gamma-Gamma & Beta-Geometric models

Linear Regression, Decision Trees for CLV prediction

Best Model: Gamma-Gamma model (Predicted lifetime revenue within 5% error margin)

7Ô∏è‚É£ Total Price Prediction

Goal: Predict the total price of an order.

Methods:

Linear Regression with Polynomial Features (Degree = 2) (Final Model)

Compared with Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, XGBoost

Best Model: Polynomial Regression (R¬≤: 0.98, RMSE: 0.1281)

8Ô∏è‚É£ Purchase Behavior Analysis

Goal: Understand purchasing trends across different customer segments.

Methods:

Time-Series Analysis (Seasonal trends, weekday/weekend purchases)

Customer segmentation & high-frequency item analysis

Results: Identified peak sales times, seasonality trends, and customer preferences.
