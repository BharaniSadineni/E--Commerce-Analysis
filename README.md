# E-Commerce Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project

üìå **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing E-Commerce transaction data to gain insights into customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and business strategies using Machine Learning. It covers customer segmentation, churn prediction, market basket analysis, revenue prediction, and customer lifetime value calculations.

üìÇ **Dataset Information**  
- **Dataset Link:** [E-Commerce Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)  
- **Number of Records:** 541,909  
- **Number of Features:** 8  
- **Key Features:** InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country  

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- Removed duplicates.
- Handled missing values (Description filled with mode; CustomerID imputed using interpolation, forward, and backward fill).
- Excluded irrelevant transactions (e.g., bank charges, postage).
- Created new feature: **TotalPrice = Quantity √ó UnitPrice**.
- Outlier handling using IQR-Based Capping, Winsorization, and Percentile-Based Capping.

üîç **Problem Statements & Methodologies**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Customer Churn Prediction**  
   - **Goal:** Identify customers likely to stop purchasing.  
   - **Methods:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CATBoost

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**  
   - **Goal:** Categorize customers into meaningful groups.  
   - **Methods:** K-Means  
   - **Features Used:** RFM metrics, purchasing frequency  
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index  
   - **Best Model:** K-Means (Optimal K = 4, Silhouette Score = 0.76)

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Predicting Customer Purchase Probability**  
   - **Goal:** Estimate the likelihood of a customer making a future purchase.  
   - **Methods:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CATBoost  
   - **Feature Engineering:** Customer tenure, purchase patterns, seasonality trends  
   - **Balancing Class Imbalance:** Assigned class weights  
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Log-Loss, ROC-AUC Score  
   - **Best Model:** CatBoost (ROC-AUC = 0.9658)

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Market Basket Analysis & Recommendation System**  
   - **Goal:** Identify frequently bought product combinations & suggest recommendations.  
   - **Methods:** Apriori Algorithm for association rules  
   - **Model Performance Assessment:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **High-Value Customer Analysis**  
   - **Goal:** Identify top-spending customers and analyze their behavior.  
   - **Methods:** RFM Analysis  
   - **Best Model:** Random Forest (Accuracy: 97.77%, AUC-ROC: 0.9966)

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction**  
   - **Goal:** Estimate future revenue from customers.  
   - **Feature Engineering:** Average Purchase Value, Customer Lifespan  
   - **Best Model:** CatBoost (R¬≤: 99.05)

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Total Price Prediction**  
   - **Goal:** Predict the total price of an order.  
   - **Methods:** Linear Regression with Polynomial Features (Degree = 2)  
   - **Best Model:** Polynomial Regression (R¬≤: 0.98, RMSE: 0.1281)
